## Deploy

Install dependancies from `composer.json`: 
```
$ composer install
```

Deploy application with artisan:
```
$ php artisan serve
```

## Configure

In order to connect the laravel installation with your database and other stuff copy the `.env.example` file:
```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

You can see the configuration in that file. Laravel will read from that file.

For example the DB connection(MySQL) configuration looks like:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```
